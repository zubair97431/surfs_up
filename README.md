# surfs_up Analysis
# The key differences between June and December are the counts and the following data in each of their dataframes. The Surf and Ice Cream shop business will run best in June as you can you see most of the statistical data is much higher in the June dataframe than the December dataframe. It will be somewhat slower in the December month. I would recommend operating at full capacity around the summer season as there will be a lot of business but slow itdown in the winter season since naturally not many people are going to surf or eat ice cream then. Overall, it should not make too much of a difference as it can be seen in the dataframes. The business will run well in both months.
